================

A replacement generator for scaffolding controllers.

This is a normal ERB file that you can download and then save as new file `lib/templates/rails/scaffold_controller/controller.rb` (you may need to create the corresponding directories manually)

###Comment out `gem 'jbuilder', '~> 1.2'` and rerun `bundle install`
